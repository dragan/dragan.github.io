### Building a Community

It's no secret that I am infatuated with the [Mono][mono] project, it's the main ingredient in [Monca&#237;][moncai].  Heck, I even named the project Monca&#237; to pay tribute to Mono, therefore it shouldn't come as a surprise that I am going to do everything within my power to evangelize Mono, .NET, and the .NET open-source projects under them to build a kick ass community ecosystem.

In order to reach that goal, another one of my main goals for this year was to resuscitate the Monospace Conference.  I found out that [Louis Salin][louis] was also looking to dust it off and I jumped at the opportunity to partner with him to organize the conference.

### Monospace 2011

Without further ado, we are happy to announce that we are officially planning [Monospace 2011][monospace] to take place in Austin, Texas in October 2011!  We got the wheels turning over the weekend by creating a sign-up page for you to show your interest while we plan the conference.  We will release more information over the coming months.  However, we can tell you now that it will last three days, with two days of sessions and one day reserved for an open space.  We are also estimating ticket prices to be around $250 and we plan for great speakers to be there from all over the .NET open-source community to give sessions over cross-platform, game, and web development using Mono and .NET.

Whether you're a new comer, a long time user, or just like to see LOLCATS in the presentations we are aiming to provide a conference to suit everybody.  There is no doubt in our minds that Monospace 2011 will be a lot of fun, so what are you waiting for, stop reading this and [go enter your email address][monospace] and we will keep you updated on the progress!
