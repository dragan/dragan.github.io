title: Introducing mope and mono-build
---

I'm happy to announce the release of [**mope**](http://github.com/dragan/mope) and [**mono-build**](http://github.com/dragan/mono-build).

I compile, install, and switch different versions of Mono all the time.  It also happens to be one of the most frustrating experiences I have to face, as a Mono developer.  Sure, I've created small pieces of snippets here and there to help with the process, but they were always just strewn about.

Things shouldn't be this way.  Not in Mono.

I finally got fed up with it this past weekend.  I wanted something where I can centralize Mono Version Management, therefore [mope](http://github.com/dragan/mope) and [mono-build](http://github.com/dragan/mono-build) were born.  They're not perfect, but it's a start.  Take a gander at the project README's for full documentation.

Last, but not least, a big thanks to [Sam Stephenson](http://sstephenson.us/) for [rbenv](http://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](http://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build).  If it wasn't for inspiration from his projects, I probably couldn't of created these projects as fast.

Enjoy!
