title: Speaking at NDC 2011
---

One of my goals to help give back to the .NET/Mono community that I am proud to be a part of, is to take up speaking.  I am excited to announce that I can cross that item off my list now, because I have my first confirmed speaking engagement at the [2011 Norwegian Developers Conference][ndc2011] from June 8th - 10th in Oslo, Norway.  I wanted to include an image of a happy monkey to show how ecstatic I am about this opportunity, but the images that showed up in my search results were a little disturbing.

I’ve been lucky enough to be given a slot on day one [June 8th from 15:00 - 16:00][ndc-agenda] to do a session on [Monca&#237;][moncai] called "Let me introduce my Monca&#237;!".  Here's the abstract:

> Cloud services are changing the way we approach developing application's.  Learn how Platform–as–a–Service (PaaS) takes it a step further and
> helps you forget about server's and focus on your problems.  We'll start by discussing the philosophies behind PaaS and then dive into using
> Monca&#237; to deploy, build, and scale your web, mobile, or social application's written in .NET.

With the keynote to be given by [Scott Guthrie][thegu] (AKA The Gu) and an agenda that contains a great selection of speakers, this years NDC is gearing up to be the best one yet.  So what are you waiting for, [get your ticket now][ndc-tickets].  I'm looking forward in meeting everybody that attends and throwing some beers back with you. 

If Norway is not a reasonable destination for you to attend a conference and if you’re interested in hearing me speak, or know of any opportunities that you think I might be interested in, please drop me an [email][email].  I'd be happy to speak about Monca&#237;, PaaS, .NET, Mono, MonoDevelop, and CouchDB.
